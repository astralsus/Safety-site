      <h2>Why Women’s Safety Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In a world where equality and respect should be the foundation of every society, 
        women’s safety stands as a fundamental right. Yet, challenges remain. 
        Every woman deserves the freedom to walk fearlessly on the streets, 
        to study, to work, and to dream without the shadow of danger holding her back. 
        This platform is a step toward that vision.

      <p>
        Seeking help is not a sign of weakness—it is an act of strength. 
        By reaching out, you protect not only yourself but also inspire others 
        to break the silence. Together, we can create a culture where support is 
        always available, voices are always heard, and no woman feels alone in her fight.
